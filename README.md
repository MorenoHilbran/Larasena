# 👕 Fabricate - 3D Shirt Modeling Website

**Fabricate** is a web-based 3D shirt modeling platform where you can design your own shirt with ease. Customize every detail—from color to logo placement—and see the changes live in an interactive 3D preview. Once you're happy with the design, download the final shirt image to share or use.

## 🌟 Features

* 🎨 **Change Shirt Color**
  Pick any color using a color picker to customize the entire shirt.

* 🖼️ **Upload Custom Designs or Logos**
  Upload your own images to apply to the shirt as designs or logos.

* 🔄 **Transform Logo (Move, Resize, Rotate)**
  Easily reposition, scale, and rotate your uploaded logo anywhere on the shirt.

* 🧅 **Real-Time 3D Preview**

* 📅 **Download Final Design**
  Export and download a snapshot of your customized shirt.
